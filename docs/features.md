## Super User Management
Super users are able to set group roles (see [Group Management](#group-management)), which are vital to control command permissions, and view group and user IDs.

Super users can be registered and unregistered in groups where super user operations are permitted. For now, only the ADMIN and SPAM TEST groups allow access to the super user commands.

## Group Management
The telebot deals with 4 (types) of groups: ADMIN, RECRE and SPAM TEST.
* The ADMIN group permits super users to run commands and control bot schedules, sessions, etc.
* The RECRE group is the official recreational group to send polls to.
* The SPAM TEST group is for large-volume testing and aims to reduce spam in the ADMIN group.
* The LOGGING group contains logs raised by the bot during operation.

> :warning:
> The SPAM TEST group will be deprecated soon. Do transfer testing/logging to the ADMIN or LOGGING group, or create your own extension if possible.

## Session Management
The telebot also allows handling of the cuesports sessions, allowing temporary changes week by week. 

The bot stores two types of sessions: active, and available. Active sessions are sessions that will be displayed to the RECRE group, but available sessions will not.
However, the bot will still store available sessions that can be declared active at any moment. Likewise, any active session can be deactivated and declared available at any time.

## Message Automation
The telebot will send Pre-Poll, Poll, End-Poll and Confirmation messages and update poll headcounts automatically.
